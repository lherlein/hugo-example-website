## Casualties

- Firefight win/loss is +/- 1 troop `size.` 
    - So if a troop `size` is 5, then it can lose 5 firefights
- Troop `size` changes persist throughout the tactical mission
- if a troop size reaches zero, it is wiped out and removed from the combat group
- if a combat group has 0 troops, it is wiped out
