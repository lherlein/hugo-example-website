Here, the engage mechanic is discussed

## Attack Order + Engage

Attack order determines *who is attacking who*. Because of the modifier system, this is very important. Some unit types want to be attacking, while some are better spent defending. 

- Attack order is determined per `engagement`
    - so each engagement has an attacker and defender
- A unit must `engage` the enemy to be attacking
    - units in the 'defending' state automatically engage spotted enemies
    - attacking units must engage a unit within their range to to be the attacker
    - __NOTE:__ A unit in 'defending' mode that engages an enemy will USE DEFENSIVE STATS AND DEFENSIVE MODIFIERS, even though it's the 'attacker'. 
        - in this scenario, both the 'attacker' and 'defender' use their defensive stats
