- troops described in combat-units

#### Combat Organization

- User
    - X `Combat Group`s
    - what moves around the map
    - has it's own speed value for map speed, different from fireteam/unit speed
        - n `fireteam` (n>1)
            - troop
            - troop
            - troop
            .
            .
            .
            n Amount

## Choices of Organization

- The player is given a set amount of troops
- The player can organize these troops into any amount of combat groups, up to a limit
    - max combat groups is troop count divided by 2
    - combat group must have at least 2 troops
    - Theoretically, the player could put all troops into a single combat group, or put only two troops into (troop count)/2 CGs
